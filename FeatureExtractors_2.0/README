Command to run the script:
    python BatchFeatureExtractor.py -i [source] -o [destination] -f [features]

Explanation:
    * [source] = Name of the source directory
    * [destination] = Name of the destination directory
    * [features] = [c-1,-1.c+1,+1.c-2,-2.c+2,+2.c-2,-1.c-1,+1.c+1,+2.c-3,-1.c-2,+1.c-1,+2.c+1,+3_p-3,+3_all]
                = name of the features (according to the feature order)
        [c-N-N] = Lemma/word-form (lower-cased) of the N-th local collocation words before the target word
        [c-N+N] = Lemma/word-form (lower-cased) of the N-th local collocation words before and after the target word
        [c+N-N] = Lemma/word-form (lower-cased) of the N-th local collocation words after and before the target word
        [c+N+N] = Lemma/word-form (lower-cased) of the N-th local collocation words after the target word
        [p-N] = POS-tag of the N-th word before the target word
        [p+N] = POS-tag of the N-th word after the target word
        [all] = All single words/uni-grams (lemma/word-form lower-cased; except, stop-words, numbers and punctuation
                symbols) in the surrounding context

Example:
    python BatchFeatureExtractor.py -i semcor/semcor3.0 -o semcor_features -f c-1,-1.c+1,+1.c-2,-2.c+2,+2.c-2,-1.c-1,+1.c+1,+2.c-3,-1.c-2,+1.c-1,+2.c+1,+3_p-3,+3_all
    python2.7 BatchFeatureExtractor.py -i data/semcor3.0/ -o data/output/ -f c-1,-1.c+1,+1.c-2,-2.c+2,+2.c-2,-1.c-1,+1.c+1,+2.c-3,-1.c-2,+1.c-1,+2.c+1,+3_p-3,+3_all
